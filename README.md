# **Host Galaxies of Merging Compact Objects**

You will find the joint probability distribution of the host galaxies of the different merging compact objects split into three different folders:

DBH: merging black hole binaries; DNS: double neutron star; BHNS: black hole neutron star binaries

Each table contains a range for stellar masses (Ms) and star formation rate (SFR) of the simulated galaxies.

You will find the following information:

- logMsmin: first column. Minimum stellar mass in log. Units: Msun 
- logMsmax: second column. Maximum stellar mass in log. Units: Msun
- logSFRmin: third column. Minimum SFR in log. Units: Msum/yr 
- logSFRmax: forth column. Maximum SFR in log. Units: Msun/yr 
- Prob: fifth column. Joint probability distribution in the range of logMsmin-logMsmax and logSFRmin-logSFRmax

------------------
The tables were created combining the galaxy catalogs from EAGLE simulation of 25Mpc of side, RecalL0025N0752 (see [Schaye et al. 2015](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.446..521S) for further details) togheter with the results from the population synthesis model MOBSE CC15Î±5 from [Giacobbo & Mapelli (2018)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.2011G)
