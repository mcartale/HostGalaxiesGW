Host Galaxies of Merging Compact Objects

You will find the joint probability distribution of the host galaxies of the different merging compact objects split into three different folders:
-merging black hole binaries (DBH)
-double neutron star (DNS) 
-black hole neutron star binaries (BHNS)

SNAPSHOTS   REDSHIFT
27-28       <~0.1
19          1.0
15          2.0
6           6.0





I will provide a larger sample at different redshifts in the near future.
