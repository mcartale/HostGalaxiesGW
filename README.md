Host Galaxies of Merging Compact Objects

You will find the joint probability distribution of the host galaxies of the different merging compact objects split into three different folders:
-merging black hole binaries (DBH)
-double neutron star (DNS) 
-black hole neutron star binaries (BHNS)

Each table contains a range for stellar masses (Ms) and star formation rate (SFR) of the simulated galaxies. \\
You will find the following information:\\
logMsmin: first column. Minimum stellar mass in log. Units: Msun \\
logMsmax: second column. Maximum stellar mass in log. Units: Msun \\
logSFRmin: third column. Minimum SFR in log. Units: Msum/yr \\
logSFRmax: forth column. Maximum SFR in log. Units: Msun/yr \\
Prob: fifth column. Joint probability distribution in the range of logMsmin-logMsmax and logSFRmin-logSFRmax 




| SNAPSHOTS     | REDSHIFT      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 27-28         | <~ 0.1        |
| 19            | 1.0           |
| 15            | 2.0           |
| 6             | 6.0           |




I will provide a larger sample at different redshifts in the near future.
